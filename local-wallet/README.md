This sample relies on packages in the root Burner-wallet-2 folder. Before using this make sure you build the dependencies, by running `yarn run build` in the root Burner-wallet-2 folder.

## Scripts

`yarn start`: Run the local script, then start the wallet. The local script will transfer ETH into the wallet address if it has a balance of 0.

`yarn start-wallet`: Start the wallet without the local script.
